/**
 * CLI specification runner for spwn — the single product runner.
 *
 * The spwn binary IS the product: every spec exercises `bin/spwn`
 * directly, never a tool underneath it. Each spec runs in a fresh temp
 * cwd; `.fixture('$FIXTURES/<project>/')` spreads a committed project
 * tree into it, `.env()` isolates the child environment.
 *
 * Docker-aware mode is opt-in via the `docker` option. The contract
 * with the binary: it labels every container it spawns with
 * `sh.spwn.test.run = <value of SPWN_TEST_LABEL>` (see
 * packages/world/internal/labels). The runner injects a per-run id into
 * SPWN_TEST_LABEL, finds containers by that label, and force-removes
 * them at scope exit — which is why every docker-aware result MUST bind
 * with `await using` (rule B5). Container lookup keys off
 * `sh.spwn.world.config` (the manifest world key) because spwn only
 * sets `sh.spwn.world.name` when the user assigns an explicit display
 * name — empty for fixture-declared worlds.
 *
 * The `env` record names the environment sets a `<case>.spec.yaml`
 * document reaches for by bare word (`env: [isolated]`). A document
 * states WHICH ground it stands on; how that ground is built stays
 * here, once.

/*

 * spawn pre-flight both run validations; a parallel e2e suite hitting
 * Anthropic /oauth/usage burns rate limits and flakes on 429s. A spec that
 * wants to exercise validation opts back in with
 * `.env({ SPWN_SKIP_AUTH_VALIDATION: null })`.
