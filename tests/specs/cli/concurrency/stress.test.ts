/**
 * CLI stress / concurrency. There is no dedicated concurrency primitive — each
 * spec is a fresh temp dir — so parallel invocations fan out with `Promise.all`
 * over an async helper that binds its own `await using` per exec (rule B5). The
 * lock-held case is docker-aware: a stale per-world lockfile is layered in via
 * the `lock-held/` overlay, and `up` must refuse without ever creating a
 * container — an assertion on the CONTAINER accessor, which is why it stays a
 * chain. The two sequential specs beside them are documents.
