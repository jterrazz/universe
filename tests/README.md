# Test Infrastructure

This document describes the test layers, tooling, and conventions used across the spwn project.

## Test Layers

### 1. Go Unit Tests

Fast, isolated tests that run without Docker. Located next to their source files as `*_test.go`.

```bash
make test                        # all unit tests across the Go workspace
make test-pkg PKG=agent          # verbose go test for a single package
make test-pkg PKG=apps/cli       # path-form also works
```

Examples:

- `packages/platform/paths_test.go` - path resolution logic
- `packages/agent/agent_test.go` - agent lifecycle
- `packages/world/manifest/manifest_test.go` - YAML parsing
- `apps/cli/cli_test.go` - flag parsing + help output

### 2. Go E2E Tests

Integration tests that spawn real Docker containers using the `spwn-test:latest` image (a mock environment with the runtime simulators in `tests/_simulators/` replacing the real Claude/Codex CLIs). Located in `packages/world/tests/e2e/`.

```bash
make test-go-e2e              # builds test image, then runs the world E2E suite
make test-compile-e2e      # separate image-build E2E under packages/compile/e2e
```

These tests use the build tag `//go:build e2e` and are excluded from `make test`.

### 3. TypeScript E2E Tests

Behavioral specs that exercise the compiled `spwn` CLI binary end-to-end. Located in `tests/specs/cli/<domain>/`. They spawn processes, interact with Docker, and assert on CLI output.

Most of them are **documents** — a `<case>.spec.yaml` stating one terminal session — and the rest are chains in `<aspect>.test.ts`. Which is which, and why, is [TypeScript E2E Setup](#typescript-e2e-setup-testsspecscli) below.

```bash
pnpm -C tests test               # run all TS E2E specs once
pnpm -C tests test:watch         # watch mode
cd tests && npx tsc --noEmit     # type-check only
```

## Prerequisites

- **Docker**: Required for all E2E tests (both Go and TypeScript).
- **Go 1.25+**: Required for Go tests.
- **Node.js 20+**: Required for TypeScript E2E tests.
- **Test image**: Run `make test-image` before E2E tests. This builds the `spwn-test:latest` Docker image from `tests/_simulators/Dockerfile.test`.
- **Binary**: TypeScript E2E tests require `bin/spwn`. Run `make build` first.

## How runtime simulators work

E2E tests do not call the real Claude Code or Codex CLIs. Instead, they use protocol-faithful **simulators** that ship inside the test image:

- `tests/_simulators/claude/mock.sh` — installed as `/usr/local/bin/claude`
- `tests/_simulators/codex/mock.sh` — installed as `/usr/local/bin/codex`
- `tests/_simulators/Dockerfile.test` — builds `spwn-test:latest` with both pre-installed

The Claude simulator:

1. Accepts and ignores real Claude CLI flags (`--session-id`, `--resume`, etc.)
2. Inspects the container environment (checks for `/agents/<name>/CLAUDE.md`, `/workspaces`, etc.)
3. Writes its observations as JSON to `/tmp/claude-mock.json`
4. Optionally writes to `/workspaces/workspace0/mock-output.txt` to prove write access
5. Supports `--exit-code` and `--sleep` flags for testing error/timeout scenarios

The Go E2E framework reads this JSON via `TestContext.ReadMockOutput()` and exposes it through `MockAssertion` (e.g., `ExpectMock(func(m) { m.SawMind(); m.SawClaudeMD() })`).

## Test Infrastructure

### Go E2E Setup (`packages/world/tests/e2e/setup/`)

| File            | Purpose                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `context.go`    | `TestContext` - creates isolated temp SPWN_HOME, connects to Docker, registers cleanup                                                                    |
| `builders.go`   | `SpawnBuilder` - fluent builder for spawning worlds with config/agent/workspace                                                                           |
| `assertions.go` | Assertion chains: `StateAssertion`, `ContainerAssertion`, `MindAssertion`, `MockAssertion`, `SessionAssertion`, `JournalAssertion`, `GateAssertion`, etc. |

**Pattern:**

```go
func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {
    chain := setup.NewSpawnBuilder(t).
        WithAgent("test-agent").
        Execute()

    chain.ExpectState(func(s *setup.StateAssertion) {
        s.WorldCount(1)
        s.HasAgent("test-agent")
    })

    chain.ExpectContainer(func(c *setup.ContainerAssertion) {
        c.IsRunning()
        c.HasMount("/agents")
    })
}
```

Key design points:

- `NewTestContext(t)` creates an isolated SPWN_HOME in `t.TempDir()` and registers `t.Cleanup()` to destroy all spawned worlds.
- `SpawnBuilder.Execute()` returns an `AssertionChain` for fluent assertions.
- `WaitFor(t, timeout, interval, desc, conditionFn)` polls a condition instead of using `time.Sleep`.

### TypeScript E2E Setup (`tests/specs/cli/`)

All TypeScript E2E specs run under `@jterrazz/test` against one
specification runner:

| File                             | Purpose                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `specs/cli/cli.specification.ts` | Exports `cli`, the single runner bound to `bin/spwn`, docker-aware, with an `env` registry |

One runner, one mental model. Whether a spec happens to touch Docker is
a property of what it asserts on, not a choice made at setup time.
CLI-only specs reach for stdout/stderr/file accessors; specs that need
container assertions add `await using` and call `.container(name)` — the
first access lazily queries Docker, and a spec that never touches it
pays nothing.

There are two ways to write a spec, and the first is the default.

#### The document — `<case>.spec.yaml`

A terminal session is already a specification: a command, its exit code,
what it printed, what it left on disk. Most of this suite says exactly
that, in a YAML document that lives **beside** the spec it belongs to
(never under `expected/`, which holds goldens, not scenarios):

```yaml
description: a valid project prints a clean success report
fixture: $FIXTURES/single-agent/
env: isolated
runs:
    - command: check
      exit: 0
      stdout: |4+
          
            ✓  Project is valid
               {{workdir}}/spwn.yaml

      files:
          spwn.yaml: { contains: 'name: demo' }
```

- `fixture:` is `.fixture()`: `$FIXTURES/<name>/` for the shared pool at
  `specs/fixtures/`, a bare name for a feature-local `fixtures/` overlay,
  a **list** to layer them in order.
- `env:` names an environment set registered in
  `cli.specification.ts` — today only `isolated`, which moves
  `SPWN_HOME` onto the spec's temp cwd. Inline `KEY=value` also works.
- `runs:` is the session. Every run is asserted, and a non-zero exit does
  **not** end it — which is what `.exec([...])` could never do, since it
  stops at the first failure and keeps only the last output.
- `stdout:`/`stderr:` are byte-exact. `|` keeps the final newline, `|-`
  drops it. Absent asserts an EMPTY stream.
- `files:` asserts what the run left behind, in four forms: `contains`
  (one needle or a list), `equals`, `exists`, `absent`.
- The whole [token vocabulary](https://github.com/jterrazz/package-test/blob/main/docs/06-tokens.md)
  works in the streams and in `files:` texts — `{{workdir}}`, `{{path}}`,
  `{{time}}`, `{{iso8601}}`, `{{hex}}`, and `{{string#ref}}` for a value
  that must be the same wherever it reappears.

The runner reports the document's own path as the test file and its
`description:` as the title, so a failing scenario opens where it is
written. `vitest.config.ts` wires the glob through the `literate()`
plugin; the shape of a document is checked by the conventions checker in
`pnpm -C tests lint`, which also has a `--fix` for key order and block
scalars.

**Regenerate a document's streams** with `TEST_UPDATE=1`:

```bash
TEST_UPDATE=1 pnpm -C tests exec vitest run specs/cli/check
```

It rewrites `exit`, `stdout` and `stderr` per run — and nothing else.
The ground, the commands and the `files:` assertions are never touched,
and a token already in place survives by pattern match, so `{{workdir}}`
stays `{{workdir}}` wherever the line moved to. **Read every regenerated
document before committing it**: a value the framework could not
recognise as volatile (a temp path it did not substitute, a random agent
name, a clock) comes back as a literal and has to be tokenised by hand.

One hazard worth knowing: `files:` in a multi-run document is evaluated
once the SESSION has finished, not after the run it is attached to.
"Absent after the first command, present after the second" needs two
results in code — see `logs/events.test.ts`.

#### The chain — `<aspect>.test.ts`

Reach for code when the format cannot state what the spec is about. Each
file that does says so in its own header; the reasons in this suite are:

| Reason                     | Example                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **containers**             | `world/`, `colony/`, `architect/`, `hooks/` — `.container(name)`, `await using`                                          |
| **structural JSON**        | `check/json-report.test.ts`, `agent/agent-list.test.ts` — `result.json` by shape                                         |
| **an absence**             | `dependency/scoped-refs.test.ts` — no entry may survive bare; `files:` says what a file contains, never what it does not |
| **a count**                | the same file — exactly one list entry after a repeated install                                                          |
| **two runs compared**      | `agent/agent-list.test.ts` — the same header from two separate invocations                                               |
| **a host shell-out**       | `agent/export.test.ts` (`tar tzf`), `build/build.test.ts` (`docker run`)                                                 |
| **host-dependent output**  | `auth/auth.test.ts` — the dashboard reads the operator's keychain                                                        |
| **a long-running process** | `web/web.test.ts` — `.exec(…, { waitFor })` plus a `pgrep` orphan check                                                  |

When only ONE assertion needs code, the session still belongs in a
document: `cli.run('<case>.spec.yaml')` runs it — its ground, its
servers, every run asserted — and resolves with the last run's result,
so the code adds only what it must:

```typescript
test('no manifest entry survives without an explicit scheme', async () => {
    // Given - init followed by three installs mixing bare, local and catalog refs
    const result = await cli.run('explicit-manifest-schemes.spec.yaml');

    // Then - every entry on disk carries its scheme
    const bare = bareEntries(result.file('spwn/agents/neo/agent.yaml').content);
    expect(bare, `manifest carries bare entries: ${bare?.join(', ')}`).toBeNull();
});
```

**Container-asserting pattern** — the same `cli`, plus `.container(...)`:

```typescript
import { expect, test } from 'vitest';

import { cli } from '../cli.specification.js';

test('up provisions a running world', async () => {
    // Given - the docker-pilot world brought online
    await using result = await cli.fixture('$FIXTURES/docker-pilot/').exec('up');

    // Then - the container is live with its agent home laid down
    expect(result.exitCode).toBe(0);
    expect(result.stderr).toContain('Created container');

    const neo = result.container('neo');
    expect(neo.running).toBe(true);
    expect(neo.file('/agents/neo/CLAUDE.md').exists).toBe(true);
});
```

- **`await using`** whenever a spec might spawn containers. The dispose
  hook force-removes every container tagged with this run's id so
  parallel runs never collide. Harmless no-op for specs that spawn
  nothing — and required by rule B5 on a docker-aware runner. A document
  needs none of this, which is the other reason a container spec stays a
  chain.
- `result.container('<world-key>')` resolves by the
  `sh.spwn.world.config` label — the key declared under `worlds.` in
  `spwn.yaml`, not the sometimes-empty `sh.spwn.world.name`.
- `result.container(name).file(path)` / `.exec(cmd)` / `.inspect.value` /
  `.stdout` / `.stderr` use the same accessor API as the host-side
  `result` — no new vocabulary.
- Follow-up CLI commands that need a container id (e.g.
  `spwn world inspect <id>`) get it via the world-id label.
- Always use the `docker-pilot` fixture (minimal agent without
  `spwn:python`). `single-agent` fails to spawn because the base image
  lacks `pip3`.
- Banners (`Created container`, `Agent is alive`, `Destroyed`,
  `World destroyed`) go to **stderr**, not stdout — spwn follows the Unix
  convention of data-on-stdout / status-on-stderr.

## Adding New Tests

### Go Unit Test

1. Create `your_file_test.go` next to the source file.
2. Use standard `testing.T` patterns.
3. Use table-driven tests where appropriate.
4. Run with `make test` or `go test ./...` in the module directory.

### Go E2E Test

1. Create `your_feature_test.go` in `packages/world/tests/e2e/`.
2. Add `//go:build e2e` build tag at the top.
3. Use `setup.NewSpawnBuilder(t)` to create test infrastructure.
4. Follow GIVEN/WHEN/THEN comment structure.
5. Run with `make test-go-e2e`.

### TypeScript E2E Test

Write a **document** unless the spec needs one of the reasons listed
under [the chain](#the-chain--aspecttestts).

1. Create `tests/specs/cli/<domain>/<case>.spec.yaml` — `<case>` in
   kebab-case, naming the scenario, never the bare folder name and never
   carrying the words `test`, `spec` or `cli` the suffix already does.
2. State the ground (`fixture:`, `env:`), then `runs:` with a `command:`
   and a guessed `exit:` per step, plus any `files:` assertion.
3. `TEST_UPDATE=1 pnpm -C tests exec vitest run <path>` fills in the exit
   codes and the streams. **Read the result** and tokenise anything
   volatile the framework left literal — a temp path it did not
   substitute, a random agent name, a clock.
4. Run it again without the flag. It must pass twice in a row.

For a chain instead:

1. Create `tests/specs/cli/<domain>/<aspect>.test.ts` and open its
   docblock with the reason the format cannot carry it.
2. Import `cli` from `../cli.specification.js`.
3. If only one ASSERTION needs code, put the session in a document and
   call `cli.run('<case>.spec.yaml')`.
4. Use `// Given -` and `// Then -` narration, in that order.
5. For Docker specs, always `await using` (rule B5).
6. Run with `pnpm -C tests exec vitest run <glob>`.

## Test File Naming Conventions

| Layer       | Pattern                                       | Example                   |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Go unit     | `*_test.go` (next to source)                  | `manifest_test.go`        |
| Go E2E      | `*_test.go` (in `tests/e2e/`)                 | `spawn_test.go`           |
| TS document | `<case>.spec.yaml` (in `specs/cli/<domain>/`) | `valid-project.spec.yaml` |
| TS chain    | `<aspect>.test.ts` (in `specs/cli/<domain>/`) | `json-report.test.ts`     |

## Test Function Naming

- **Go**: `TestFeature_Scenario` (e.g., `TestSpawn_CreatesRunningContainer`)
- **TypeScript document**: the `description:` line IS the vitest title —
  one lowercase line, no trailing period, unique within its folder.
- **TypeScript chain**: `test("scenario description")`, same rules.

## Vitest Configuration

`tests/vitest.config.ts` is one project over `specs/cli/**` and
`specs/lint/**`, with the `literate()` plugin adding
`specs/cli/**/*.spec.yaml` to the include and binding every document to
`specs/cli/cli.specification.ts`.

- `testTimeout: 120_000` — the docker-aware specs spawn real containers;
  CLI-only specs finish in milliseconds, so the upper bound is harmless.
- `hookTimeout: 180_000` — setup hooks and the first container boot are
  slow on cold CI runners.
- `fileParallelism: true` — spwn scopes every world lookup by the
  `SPWN_TEST_LABEL` the framework injects per spec, and the framework
  force-removes each run's containers by that label at scope exit, so
  two parallel specs both spawning a "neo" world route to their own
  container.
- The real-build smoke spec runs separately, via
  `vitest.smoke.config.ts` (`make test-smoke`).
